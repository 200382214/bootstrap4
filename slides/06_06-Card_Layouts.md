# Bootstrap 4
Card Layout

> > Speaker Notes:
There is a number of ways to control the layout of your cards. Some are simpler than others and what's different is how the elements align.

## <i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> Card Layout Containers

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">`card-group`</li>
	<li class="fragment">`card-deck`</li>
  <li class="fragment">`card-columns`</li>
  <li class="fragment">Rows &amp; Columns</li>
</ul>

> > Speaker Notes:
Bootstrap has three different classes to make it simpler to create columns.
1. The first is card-group. It creates a group that's similar to a button group. The cards come together with a shared border.
2. There's a second class called card-deck. If you want spacing between the columns, this is the easiest way to set things up.
3. Finally, there's card columns. This makes a really interesting layout where the cards align similarly to what you would see in pinterest.

## Demo

## Conclusion
You should practice the different layout controls. The built in column formats are definitely the easiest, but you pay for it with a lack of customization.
